Creating a profitable Python-based bot can be challenging. Even when you have an algorithm idea with which you are satisfied, optimizing its parameters can be frustrating and time-consuming.

That’s why our research team built the Optimizer. A new feature for the backtester when creating Python Code Bots, the Optimizer will allow you to automate the parameter optimization process. When writing your bot code, you simply define relevant parameters and their respective ranges that you want to be optimized in order to achieve the highest PnL, and then let the Optimizer do its magic.

# How Do Crypto Trading Bots Actually Work?

In order to trade on an exchange, a trading bot needs access to your exchange account, which you grant by using API keys (Application Program Interface). When the bot is connected to your exchange with an API key, it can trade on your behalf based on your instructions. When authorization has been revoked, the bot can no longer access your account and trading ceases. You are in full control.

**data analysis > signal generation > risk allocation > execution**

The actual process behind trading bots occurs in four main stages. The first stage involves data analysis, while the second stage basically automates the type of work that the trader does by introducing the data into a signal generator in order to look for trading opportunities or analyze price trends and patterns. The third stage involves risk allocation in which the bot spreads out the risk based on the trader’s preferences. And the final stage is the execution during which the signals are converted into requests for API keys that the exchange uses to buy and/or sell.

# The Many Advantages of Crypto Trading Bots

When it comes to cryptocurrency trading, there are no opening or closing bells. Crypto markets never sleep, which means that any downtime that we take to eat, sleep, walk the dog or head to the shops translates into missed opportunities.

There’s also the elephant in the room. Wall Street. You’ve probably already read that 80% of stock market trading is performed by algorithmic programs. Private traders are often put off by their perceptions of algorithmic trading. It’s too complicated. It’s expensive. We’re here to tell you that it’s neither and we’ve designed a cutting-edge platform with advanced tools and an array of educational resources as proof.

So what are some of the advantages of using trading bots? We can think of a handful:

✅ Emotionless trading
✅ Higher trading speeds
✅ Risk diversification
✅ Consistent trading discipline

# Best Practices for Creating Successful Trading Bots

Practice makes perfect and it’s no different with algorithmic trading. Before going live with your bot, you’ll want to become completely comfortable with the ins and outs of algorithmic trading, which is why you should backtest and paper trade in order to simulate trades before engaging in actual ones. And be sure to read through [Trality Docs](https://docs.trality.com), an important part of our website that contains a wealth of informative material written in plain English.

But there is also the matter of best practices. It’s one thing to create a trading bot, but quite another to create a successful trading bot in a manner that is both prudent and efficient. While we don’t have the magic key that will unlock the door to wealth via automated trading, we do know a thing or two about the value of working within a general framework designed to meet and exceed certain benchmarks safely and strategically.

Consider some of the following points as best practices when thinking about, developing, and implementing a trading bot (or bots).

# Backtest, Backtest, and Backtest Some More

Would you buy a car without taking it for a test drive? Think of “backtesting” as basically like taking your crypto trading bot for a “test drive.” In fact, you should take it for multiple test drives under different conditions to ensure that it performs safely and predictably before driving it through the crowded cryptocurrency market. Only after you’ve backtested it repeatedly using historical data will you have a more accurate picture of how well (or not so well) your trading strategy is expected to perform in the future.

# Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results

Perfect, you’ve done your due diligence by treating your trading bot to a battery of backtesting, including Trality’s proprietary Optimizer, and it has performed well consistently. You’re not out of the woods yet. Once you take it live, you should continue to pay close attention to how it performs. It’s a rare thing that works perfectly straight out of the box. If we continue with our car analogy, upgraded engines or suspension systems always need a fair bit of additional fine tuning in order to achieve optimal results safely and reliably. The same principle applies to trading bots.

# Diversify Your Investment Portfolio

Variety may be the spice of life, but a diversified portfolio will reduce a trader’s exposure to any one particular asset. But beyond risk mitigation, diversity is important for things such as producing a smoother equity curve. Let’s say you’ve decided to trade a dozen different cryptocurrencies, but they’re producing the same signals. In this case, diversity is a moot point, since you’d be better off just trading one coin. The goal is to aim for sufficient diversification of signals in order to justify multiple coins and thereby position your portfolio for future returns.

# Be Part of the FinTech Revolution

High-frequency trading has harnessed the tremendous advances in computing power in order to deploy algorithms in a range of financial applications, which have proven to be more efficient than their human counterparts.
